# 🧪 My NixOS Dotfiles

Hey there! This is my NixOS setup—crafted with care for web devs like me who like things clean, reproducible, and a bit nerdy. It's got everything I need: system configs, Home Manager, and of course, Neovim (because I use nvim btw).

---

## 📦 What's Inside?

```
.
├── nixos             # System configuration (goes in /etc/nixos)
├── home-manager      # User-level config with standalone Home Manager (goes in ~/.config/home-manager)
└── nvim              # My Neovim setup (lives in ~/.config/nvim)
```

## ✨ Why NixOS?

I use **NixOS** to keep my system tidy and predictable. Declarative config is just _chef’s kiss_—no more “it worked on my machine” nonsense.

## 🧰 Home Manager FTW

I roll with **standalone Home Manager**—it lets me manage my whole user environment without messing up the system config. Super modular, super clean.

## 🖋 Neovim, Obviously

Of course I use Neovim. I’ve set it up with all the essentials—smooth, fast, and ready for anything.

Path: `~/.config/nvim`

## 🛠 My Dev Setup Highlights

- ⚡️ Tailored for **web development** (JavaScript, React—you name it)
- 📱 Android Studio is ready for **React Native** (a bit low-res for now, but it works)
- 📡 ADB is set up so you can build/run mobile apps easily

## 🫡 That’s a Wrap

That’s my dotfiles setup. If you're into NixOS or want a cool dev environment that just works, give it a spin. Good luck and happy hacking!
